                                <p>
                                  Management responsibilities may be delegated by Treasury Board to ministers or public servants.<br /> 
                                  Considerations in delegating include the ability to manage the responsibility and the associated risks.

                                <p>As you may recall, the decision on how to pay for a new initiative is made by the minister of finance and the prime minister. Their decisions are communicated in the budget and ultimately, approved by Parliament.</p>
                                <p>Within the executive branch, Treasury Board decides when to put forward a spending request to Parliament; and establishes policies governing how the money will be managed once Parliament approves the spending.</p>

                                <p>In deciding when to put forward a spending request to Parliament, Treasury Board, with the help of Treasury Board Secretariat, scrutinizes each organization’s plan for managing the money they seek.</p>
                                <p>This scrutiny occurs by reviewing submissions requesting various authorities from Treasury Board. </p>

                                        <li><strong>Contracting authority</strong> – to enter into large contracts; and</li>
                                        <li><strong>Project management authority</strong> – to manage the complex development of a new capability (e.g. stemming from the acquisition of new equipment, setting up a significant program -- essentially any work that would benefit from disciplined project management).</li>
                                    </ul>
