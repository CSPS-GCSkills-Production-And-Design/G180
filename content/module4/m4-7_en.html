                    <p>When you think about the role you should play,
                     the important thing to remember is that everybody
                     in the public service has a role to play
                     and I often like to think of results and delivery
                     as consisting of sort of three roles that occur
                     at multiple levels of government.<br />
                     <br />The first role is that of the kind of leader or executive.
                     That&apos;s the person who&apos;s holding others accountable for results
                     so at the very top level that&apos;s the PM, right?
                     The second role is that of the kind of accountable leader,
                     the person that that chief executive is looking to say,
                     &quot;I&apos;m counting on you to deliver these results in this file
                     or in that area of responsibility&quot;.
                     Again at the top level, those are the ministers.
                     And then the third role is that of sort of the broker,
                     the person who&apos;s kind of facilitating
                     the accountability relationship between the first two;
                     managing regular performance dialogues of progress
                     and then giving an objective perspective about progress.
                     That&apos;s the results and delivery unit at the top level.
                     But the important thing to note is that what you want to see
                     is those three roles replicated not just at the top level
                     but throughout government.<br />
                     <br />So if you&apos;re an ADM you might ask yourself,
                     there are certain spheres of influence in which I am working
                     for the accountable leader, my minister,
                     and I&apos;m helping them be responsive to, you know,
                     the line of accountability from the top
                     for a particular government priority.
                     Great, I&apos;m the accountable leader in that scenario.
                     There may be another case where you&apos;re an ADM and you&apos;re saying,
                     &quot;Actually, there&apos;s a particular program area
                     that I&apos;m responsible for and I want to use these tools
                     to define the results I want to achieve within that
                     and I want to appoint accountable leaders
                     and make sure that this information is coming to me
                     and that I&apos;m managing using the same approach.&quot;
                     Right? So it cascades down through the system.
                     And then there are some people who will say,
                     &quot;Actually, I think I&apos;m the broker role.&quot;
                     So the chief results and delivery officers,
                     but not just them, might find themselves saying,
                     You know what, I think my responsibility is to broker
                     lines of accountability to make sure that the program
                     is properly defined, the priorities are set,
                     the planning is done and that the routines happen.&quot;
                     And again my general message is everyone has a role to play
                     and the question is where do you see yourself,
                     right, and using the tools that we&apos;re putting out
                     to ask where do you see yourself
                     and how can I begin to step up and play that role?</p>
