        	<li>Parliament is dissolved and therefore unable to hold the government to account.</li><br />
			<li>While ministers retain their positions, their involvement in making decisions is reduced, both to allow them to participate in the election and to avoid unfairly influencing the outcome of the election.</li><br />
			<li>Similarly, during an election, it becomes important for the public service to respect the democratic process and guard against unduly influencing the outcome.</li><br />
			<li>During this period, the public service readies for the transition to the new government, preparing for all likely election outcomes.</li>
