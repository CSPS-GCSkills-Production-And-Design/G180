         <p begin="00:00:05.29" end="00:00:07.75">When you think about the role you should play,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:07.75" end="00:00:09.75">the important thing to remember is that everybody</p>
         <p begin="00:00:09.75" end="00:00:12.79">in the public service has a role to play</p>
         <p begin="00:00:12.79" end="00:00:15.45">and I often like to think of results and delivery</p>
         <p begin="00:00:15.45" end="00:00:17.95">as consisting of sort of three roles that occur</p>
         <p begin="00:00:17.95" end="00:00:19.62">at multiple levels of government.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:19.62" end="00:00:23.45">The first role is that of the kind of leader or executive.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:23.45" end="00:00:26.00">That&apos;s the person who&apos;s holding others accountable for results</p>
         <p begin="00:00:26.00" end="00:00:29.12">so at the very top level that&apos;s the PM, right?</p>
         <p begin="00:00:29.12" end="00:00:32.66">The second role is that of the kind of accountable leader,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:32.66" end="00:00:36.00">the person that that chief executive is looking to say,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:36.00" end="00:00:39.70">&quot;I&apos;m counting on you to deliver these results in this file</p>
         <p begin="00:00:39.70" end="00:00:41.45">or in that area of responsibility&quot;.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:41.45" end="00:00:43.79">Again at the top level, those are the ministers.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:44.41" end="00:00:47.33">And then the third role is that of sort of the broker,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:47.33" end="00:00:49.29">the person who&apos;s kind of facilitating</p>
         <p begin="00:00:49.29" end="00:00:51.95">the accountability relationship between the first two;</p>
         <p begin="00:00:51.95" end="00:00:54.62">managing regular performance dialogues of progress</p>
         <p begin="00:00:54.62" end="00:00:57.66">and then giving an objective perspective about progress.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:57.66" end="00:00:60.20">That&apos;s the results and delivery unit at the top level.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:60.20" end="00:00:62.70">But the important thing to note is that what you want to see</p>
         <p begin="00:00:62.70" end="00:00:65.00">is those three roles replicated not just at the top level</p>
         <p begin="00:00:65.00" end="00:00:66.62">but throughout government.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:66.62" end="00:00:69.54">So if you&apos;re an ADM you might ask yourself,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:69.54" end="00:00:72.45">there are certain spheres of influence in which I am working</p>
         <p begin="00:00:72.45" end="00:00:75.00">for the accountable leader, my minister,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:75.00" end="00:00:79.41">and I&apos;m helping them be responsive to, you know,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:79.41" end="00:00:81.54">the line of accountability from the top</p>
         <p begin="00:00:81.54" end="00:00:83.00">for a particular government priority.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:83.00" end="00:00:85.58">Great, I&apos;m the accountable leader in that scenario.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:85.58" end="00:00:88.16">There may be another case where you&apos;re an ADM and you&apos;re saying,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:88.16" end="00:00:90.33">&quot;Actually, there&apos;s a particular program area</p>
         <p begin="00:00:90.33" end="00:00:93.16">that I&apos;m responsible for and I want to use these tools</p>
         <p begin="00:00:93.16" end="00:00:96.29">to define the results I want to achieve within that</p>
         <p begin="00:00:96.29" end="00:00:98.25">and I want to appoint accountable leaders</p>
         <p begin="00:00:98.25" end="00:00:100.25">and make sure that this information is coming to me</p>
         <p begin="00:00:100.25" end="00:00:102.37">and that I&apos;m managing using the same approach.&quot;</p>
         <p begin="00:00:102.37" end="00:00:104.79">Right? So it cascades down through the system.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:104.79" end="00:00:106.62">And then there are some people who will say,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:106.62" end="00:00:108.50">&quot;Actually, I think I&apos;m the broker role.&quot;</p>
         <p begin="00:00:108.50" end="00:00:110.62">So the chief results and delivery officers,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:110.62" end="00:00:113.00">but not just them, might find themselves saying,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:113.00" end="00:00:116.41">&quot;You know what, I think my responsibility is to broker</p>
         <p begin="00:00:116.41" end="00:00:118.66">lines of accountability to make sure that the program</p>
         <p begin="00:00:118.66" end="00:00:121.20">is properly defined, the priorities are set,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:121.20" end="00:00:123.58">the planning is done and that the routines happen.&quot;</p>
         <p begin="00:00:123.58" end="00:00:126.41">And again my general message is everyone has a role to play</p>
         <p begin="00:00:126.41" end="00:00:129.20">and the question is where do you see yourself,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:129.20" end="00:00:131.62">right, and using the tools that we&apos;re putting out</p>
         <p begin="00:00:131.62" end="00:00:133.00">to ask where do you see yourself</p>
         <p begin="00:00:133.00" end="00:00:135.16">and how can I begin to step up and play that role?</p>
