        <p>The <strong>Prime Minister and Cabinet Ministers</strong> delegate responsibilities to <strong>Deputy Heads</strong> (often  called Deputy Ministers or President).
Deputy heads are therefore accountable to the prime minister and the ministers for those responsibilities with ultimate accountability resting with the prime minister who appointed them.  </p>

		<p>Additionally, deputy heads are given responsibilities directly through legislation, (e.g. the Financial Administration Act), or by other entities such as the Public Service Commission, creating multiple accountability relationships (i.e. to Parliament, to Treasury Board, to the Public Service Commission).</p>
