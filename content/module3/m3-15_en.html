               <p>After significant progress in implementing an agenda, the prime minister will typically ask the governor general to prorogue Parliament to allow him or her to return to a new Parliamentary session, with a new set of priorities, in a new Speech from the Throne. </p>
                        <p>The second Speech from the Throne is based on what the government believes the country expects it to give priority to and positions the governing party for the next election.</p>
