        <p>The <strong>Budget</strong> is the governmentâ€™s spending plan for its agenda priorities in a given year. Money may also be allocated in the budget for other reasons such as program integrity.</p>  

		<p>As well, new priorities can be communicated in the budget rather than waiting for another Speech from the Throne.</p>  
		<p>When the budget is read in Parliament, the government is communicating its spending plan.  </p>
